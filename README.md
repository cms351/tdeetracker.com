# tdeetracker.com

TDEETracker.com is a personal project of mine that allows you to input your daily calorie intake and weight, 
and then outputs your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), or the amount of calories you burn on an average day. 
The website includes user registration, log in, password encryption and the ability to save personal tracking logs. 
The website is active at tdeetracker.com. It was built with a React frontend and a Node, Express, and MySQL backend.
